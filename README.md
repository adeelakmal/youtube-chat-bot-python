#Youtube Chatbot Python
This is a YouTube chat bot that I implemented using the YouTube Data API in python  the bot has a limited set of commands right now but it is easy to add new commands

#Working
You will need to get the client secret file from the youtube data api and the live chat id.
You can get the client secret from the youtube data api page for the live chat id you can get that from the live chat url.
